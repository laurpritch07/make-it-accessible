            <h3>My accessibility journey</h3>
            <p> My journey with accessibility began when my daughter Frankie was born. Frankie was born with Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome and although I know I was aware of accessibility issues before she was born, the meaning and importance of it completely changed after I started navigating the world with her and started to realize the barriers that people with disabilities encounter everyday.
                When Frankie was about 9 months old, I took my first class in the MAGWD program at MCAD. The course was Web Development and it's where I first encountered the topic of web accessibility.
               
                (add line here about web accessibility) 
               
                This is about the time I started an accessibility bookmark folder and started dumping articles and tools that I would encounter in my research for future reference. Although I didn’t know it then this attempt to create a central location for accessibility resources was the start of my capstone project, <a href="index.html">Make it accessible. </a>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                -- Need to rewrite - connect with accessibility journey section---
                The vast majority of websites are inaccessible to people with disabilities. By some estimates only 3% of the internet is accessible. And over the last 30 years, the web has actually become a less accessible place in large part because of design. 

                Design plays a big part in web accessibility, upwards of 67% of web accessibility issues occur in the design phase.(Add citation here: Luken)

                
                I believe most designers working today understand the importance of accessibility, but as new designer it can be really challenging to get your bearings around accessibility guidelines and knowing what....
                
                The problem isn’t that there aren’t enough good resources out there, it's actually the opposite. There are so many resources that it can be overwhelming for someone new to web design to understand what exactly they need to know. There’s a lot of material out there, but it’s not always easy to understand. When I started learning web design I found myself going down rabbit holes of research only to pop back up hours later unsure of what I set out to find in the first place....

                But as overwhelming as it may be, the fact is, design plays a really big part in ensuring digital spaces are accessible. Accessibility should be at the core of the design process. However, most designers don’t feel knowledgeable enough about accessibility to confidently incorporate it into their process.
                
                I craved a more defined resource that equipped designers with a basic understanding of web accessibility (with clear actionables...) and that’s what I set out to create with this capstone.

            <h3>Questions and Thoughts Towards a Solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="large">
                    Why is accessibility mainly thought of as a compliance issue? Rather than an inherent design
                    requirement?
                </li>

                <li class="large">
                    How can designing for accessibility be built into the design process from the very beginning, not
                    just an add-on?
                </li>

                <li class="large">
                    Why does there continue to be so much fuzziness around accessibility in design?

                    How can I create a welcoming space for people to learn about accessibility without overwhelming

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                The research process for this project began with a dive into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Before I started wireframing or 
                I wanted to get a really solid understanding of what the guidelines were all about and what all they included, so I could decide what guidelines would be most relevant to a designer. From there I started diving deeper into best practices and ways in which I could bring context to the recommendations.


            </p>

            <p>
                To gain a better understanding of current trends around accessibility and development, I reached out to subject matter experts, educators, and fellow MAGWD grads. I spoke with a UX designer and educator working in healthcare, a director of design for the communications department of a private college, a web accessibility subject matter expert and educator, a principal web architect, and a digital design lead at a software company.
                

                The research I conducted and the conversations I had were immensely helpful in getting a better understanding of the challenges around accessibility in design. The feeback I recieved helped shape this project in new directions. Key takeaways included:

            <h3>Process and tools</h3>
            <p>
                The creation of this resource guide involved, wireframing (FIGMA), prototyping (FIGMA), developing (HTML, CSS, Javascript) as well as various accessibility tools used throughout the process to aid in testing and refinement. Tools used to help make the guide more accessible:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NonVisual Dekstop Access (NVDA)</a> a free and open-source screen reader to help </li>
                    <li><a href="https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com">Eightshapes Contrast Grid</a>a tool for testing foreground and background color combinations with WCAG 2.0 minimum contrast</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.whocanuse.com">Whocanuse</a>a tool that helps you understand how color contrast can affect different people with visual impairments.</li>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p> One of the major considerations guiding this design was that I wanted visitors to feel comfortable in the space. A central place where designers can come to understand the basics of web accessibility. Discuss design here...

            <h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>
            <p>
                The central deliverable of this project is a digital resource guide that focuses on providing designers
                and their teams with a clear introduction to web accessibility and ways in which they can start
                implementing more accessible practices in their design work.
            </p>

            <p>
                The guide is broken down into four main sections:
            </p>
            <p><b>Color and contrast.</b> This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
                accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast. </p>
            <p><b>Typography and Language.</b> This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
                accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast. </p>
            <p><b>Layout and Hierarchy</b> This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
                accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast. </p>
            <p><b>Animation and Interactions</b> This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
                accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast. </p>

            <p>
                Within each section there are subsections that directly related to WCAG guidelines for example, Color
                Use adresses the WCAG Guideline. Beyond the guideline the section covers Who is affected by the design
                consideration, how you can be more mindful as well as how to test your work and finally additinal
                resources to dig a little deeper into accessibility.

            <p>
                This resource guide aims to arm designers with a general knowledge of WCAG design guidelines, best
                practices for using design to create more accessible web environments, and a collection of resources to
                encourage designers to take action and start implementing more accessible processes in their practice.

            <p>
                This project has pushed me as a designer and equipped me with a resource that I can continue to build
                on.

                My hope is that this guide will also help others develop a more inclusive design practice with
                accessibility considered from the first sketch to the final handoff. --need rewrite
