                <h3>My accessibility journey</h3>
                <p>
                    I took my first class in the MAGWD program back in January 2021. It was Web development and it is where I first encountered the topic of digital accessibility. Leading up to that class I had spent the past 9 months thinking about accessibility and more specifically inclusion.  



When my daughter was born, my trajectory completely changed. Like most parents there is a before kid and after kid life. But along with Frankie’s birth came a diagnosis, Trisomy 21 - Down syndrome. 
Over the next few months, I would reserach endlessly, trying to one prepare myself for what was ahead but also understand —

When I started the web development course, I was staying at home with my daughter - to me thinking about graphic design and accessible experiences go hand in hand.

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    As I progressed through the program I tried to consider accessibility in each project. Alot of times coming out with more questions than solutions. I considered things like accessible wayfinding for school aged children with cognitive disabilities....
                     As I approached my final semester I considered what I would like to focus on, what would be a good use of my time…. I had considered doing something related to Down syndrome right away - but everything felt …. What I really wanted to do was spend the semester really diving into understanding accessibility. 
                     
                     Over the past year, I had been encountering the topic of accessibility alot at in my professional work- but I never felt prepared to handle them. I would dig into research. It was an incredibly time consuming way - but there 

I wanted to build a foundation, a guide for myself to build an accessibility practice on. Instead of digging around each time I had a question or concern - I wanted to consult my previous research in a clear and organized way - as I encountered new or challenging information I wanted to bring that into the light and look at the guidance together, I wanted to collect best practices and guidance that I had collected from books and medium articles, webinars - things that were necessarily part of official WCAG guidance but could help me have a better more holistic way of approaching a given problem. 

And I thought if this confusion around accessibility was happening for me, then surely there were other designers that craved more information as to how to design more accessibly. And so from this place - I dove into research.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Why is accessibility mainly thought of as a compliance issue? Rather than an inherent design requirement? 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        How can designing for accessibility be built into the design process from the very beginning, not just an add-on?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Why does there continue to be so much fuzziness around accessibility in design?
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        How can I create a welcoming space for people to learn about accessibility without overwhelming them?

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    The research process for this project really began back in 2021 when I took my first course in the MAGWD program, long before I had conceived of this project. It began by notes and endless bookmarks labeled ‘Accessibility’ 

                To kick off the research part of the project, I started by diving into understanding all WCAG guidelines related to design. Guidelines like, 

                I then branched out into doing more general research around disability history, designing inclusive components. 
                
                From here, I started to imagine what this space would look like? How should the guidelines be balanced by visuals and additional guidance from other designers? I have found so many incredible resources in my research, so I knew I wanted to find a way to highlight these resources. I began developing wireframes. 
                
                
                About midway through the semester, I reached out to subject matter experts, designers and developers to gain a better understanding into accessibility in design. I spoke with a UX designer and accessibility instructor who works on a large team in healthcare, a fellow classmate in the MAGWD program who is the director of design and user experience at private College in Minnesota, a VP and consultant and accessibility educator and mentor, a front end developer who has experience working across teams, and another designer who works as part of team on a startup..
                This experience was incredibly helpful to my project, as my experience is very much that of a designer working alone on a project. It was incredibly helpful to hear how other designers work with a team, across different departments .
                The research I conducted and the conversations I had  were immensely helpful in getting a better understanding of the challenges around accessibility in design and ultimately these conversations have helped redefine Capstone's problem as less about the individual designer and more about the collective gap we are facing as designers in regard to education and our professional practice.
