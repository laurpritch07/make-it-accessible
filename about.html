            <h3>My accessibility journey</h3>
            <p> My journey with accessibility began with the birth of my daughter, Frankie, who was born with Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome. Although I was previously aware of accessibility issues, the meaning and importance of it completely changed after I started navigating the world with her and realized the barriers that people with disabilities encounter everyday.</p>
                
                <p>When Frankie was about 9 months old, I took my first class in the MAGWD program at MCAD. The course was Web Development and it's where I first encountered the topic of web accessibility. This is about the time I started an accessibility bookmark folder and began gathering articles and tools that I would encounter in my research for future reference. Although I didn’t know it then, this attempt to create a central location for accessibility resources was the start of my capstone project, <a href="index.html">Make it accessible. </a></p>

        <div class="center-50">
            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>
                The vast majority of websites are inaccessible to people with disabilities. By some estimates only 3% of the internet is accessible.              
            </p>


            <p>
                Accessibility should be at the core of the design process, but for those new to the field it can be really challenging to successfully integrate accessibility guidelines and best practices into their practice. The problem isn’t that there aren’t enough good resources out there, it's actually the opposite. There are so many resources that it can be overwhelming for someone new to web design to understand what exactly they need to know. Additionally, the abundance of material is often difficult to understand. When I started learning web design I found myself going down rabbit holes of research only to pop back up hours later unsure of what I set out to find in the first place. I made a lot of accessibility mistakes unknowingly and these were things that easily could have been avoided if I had a baseline understanding of what accessibility guidelines directly related to design.          
            </p>

            <p>
                Digital media has the power to bring people together, to help remove barriers and provide every single user with a unique experience tailored to their needs and preferences, but that is only possible if we make accessibility a key measure of success for every project.               
            </p>

            <p>
                It became clear that I craved a more defined resource that could equip designers with a basic understanding of web accessibility and that’s what I set out to create with this capstone.

            <h3>Questions and thoughts towards a solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="large">
                    Why is accessibility mainly thought of as a compliance issue? Rather than an inherent design
                    requirement?
                </li>

                <li class="large">
                    How can designing for accessibility be built into the design process from the very beginning, not
                    just an add-on?
                </li>

                <li class="large">
                    Why does there continue to be so much fuzziness around accessibility in design?
                </li>

                <li class="large">
                    How can I create a welcoming space for people to learn about accessibility without overwhelming
                    them?
                </li>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
                The research process for this project began with an examination into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Before I started wireframing, I wanted to get a solid understanding of what the guidelines were all about and what all they included, so I could decide what would be most relevant to a designer. From there I continued further analysis into best practices and ways in which I could bring context to the recommendations.
            </p>

            <p>
                To gain a better understanding of current trends around accessibility and development, I reached out to subject matter experts, educators, and fellow MAGWD grads. I spoke with a UX designer and educator working in healthcare, a director of design for the communications department of a private college, a web accessibility subject matter expert and educator, a principal web architect, and a digital design lead at a software company. The conversations I had were immensely helpful in getting a better understanding of the challenges around accessibility in design. The feedback I received helped shape this project in new directions.
                </p>

                <p>Key takeaways from this feedback include:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Creating more clarity in the delivery of the WCAG guidance.</li>
                        <li>Considering the role everyone on the team (not just the designer) plays in ensuring accessibility.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Process and tools</h3>
            <p>
                The creation of this resource guide involved, wireframing (FIGMA), prototyping (FIGMA), developing (HTML, CSS, Javascript) as well as various accessibility tools used throughout the process to aid in testing and refinement. </p>

            <p class="pull-quote">“What we have are a few people who know a lot about accessibility. What we need are a lot
                of people to know a little about it.” <br>– Matt May</p>

                <h3>Arriving at a solution</h3>

            <p>
                The central deliverable of this project is a digital hub of design guidelines, best practices, and resources aimed at helping designers create more accessible work. 
            
            </p>

            <p>
                The guide is broken down into four main sections:
            </p>
            <p><b>Color and contrast.</b>  </p> 
            <!-- This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
            accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast. -->
            <p><b>Typography and Language.</b></p>
            <!-- This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
            accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast.  -->
            <p><b>Layout and Hierarchy.</b></p>
            <!-- This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
            accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast.  -->
            <p><b>Animation and Interactions.</b> </p>
            <!-- This section looks at ways in which color can play a role in ensuring
                accessibility. Topics covered include: Use of color, Contrast minimum, Non-text contrast.  -->

            <p>
                The four main sections are further subdivided into smaller sections relating to specific accessibility guidelines. For example the Color and Contrast section addresses Use of Color (WCAG 1.4.1), Contrast Minimum (WCAG 1.4.3), and Non-text Contrast (WCAG 1.4.11). Each section addresses WCAG criteria, why it is important (who it affects), how to ensure your designs address the criteria (best practices), and resources selected to offer continued learning.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                This resource guide aims to empower designers with a general knowledge of WCAG design guidelines, best practices for using design to create more accessible web environments, and a collection of resources to encourage designers to take action and start implementing more accessible processes in their practice.

            <p>
                This project has pushed me as a designer and equipped me with a resource that I can continue to build on. My hope is that this guide will also help others develop a more inclusive design practice with accessibility considered from the first sketch to the final handoff.</p>
