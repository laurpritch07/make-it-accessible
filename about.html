                <h3>My accessibility journey</h3>
                <p> When my daughter was born, my trajectory completely changed. Like most parents there is a before kid and after kid life. But with Frankie’s birth also came a diagnosis, Trisomy 21 - Down syndrome. 
I spent the first few months of her life researching and going to appointments. I wanted to understand Down syndrome and learn how I could best support my daughter. Around this time I took my first class in the MAGWD program. The class was Web development and it's where I first encountered the topic of digital accessibility. This

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    As I progressed through the program I tried to consider accessibility in each project. Alot of times coming out with more questions than solutions. I considered things like accessible wayfinding for school aged children with cognitive disabilities....
                     As I approached my final semester I considered what I would like to focus on, what would be a good use of my time…. I had considered doing something related to Down syndrome right away - but everything felt …. What I really wanted to do was spend the semester really diving into understanding accessibility. 
                     
                     Over the past year, I had been encountering the topic of accessibility alot at in my professional work- but I never felt prepared to handle them. I would dig into research. It was an incredibly time consuming way - but there 

I wanted to build a foundation, a guide for myself to build an accessibility practice on. Instead of digging around each time I had a question or concern - I wanted to consult my previous research in a clear and organized way - as I encountered new or challenging information I wanted to bring that into the light and look at the guidance together, I wanted to collect best practices and guidance that I had collected from books and medium articles, webinars - things that were necessarily part of official WCAG guidance but could help me have a better more holistic way of approaching a given problem. 

And I thought if this confusion around accessibility was happening for me, then surely there were other designers that craved more information as to how to design more accessibly. And so from this place - I dove into research.

                        Why is accessibility mainly thought of as a compliance issue? Rather than an inherent design requirement?

                        How can designing for accessibility be built into the design process from the very beginning, not just an add-on?

                    <li class="large">
                        Why does there continue to be so much fuzziness around accessibility in design?

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                The research process for this project began back in 2021 when I took my first course in the MAGWD program and created a bookmarks tab labeled ‘Accessibility’ in an attempt to start to create a central location for accessibility related information. 

                As I continued through each course of the program my accessibility grew larger. 
                    

                To kick off the research part of the project, I started by diving into understanding all WCAG guidelines related to design. Guidelines like, 

                I then branched out into doing more general research around disability history, designing inclusive components. 
                
                From here, I started to imagine what this space would look like? How should the guidelines be balanced by visuals and additional guidance from other designers? I have found so many incredible resources in my research, so I knew I wanted to find a way to highlight these resources. I began developing wireframes. 
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    About midway through the semester, I reached out to subject matter experts, designers, and developers to gain a better understanding into accessibility in design. I spoke with a UX designer and accessibility instructor who works on a large team in healthcare, a fellow classmate in the MAGWD program who is the director of design and user experience at private College in Minnesota, a VP and consultant and accessibility educator and mentor, a front end developer who has experience working across teams, and another designer who works as part of team on a startup..

                The research I conducted and the conversations I had  were immensely helpful in getting a better understanding of the challenges around accessibility in design.

                <p>
                    The central deliverable of this project is a digital resource guide that focuses on providing designers and their teams with a clear introduction to web accessibility and ways in which they can start implementing more accessible practices in their design work. 

    
                <p>
                
                <p>
                    The guide is broken down into four main sections: 

                    <ul>
                        <li>Color and contrast</li>
                        <li>Typography and Language</li>
                        <li>Layout and Hierarchy</li>
                        <li>Animation and Interactions</li>
                    </ul>

                    Within each section there are subsections that directly related to WCAG guidelines for example, Color Use adresses the WCAG Guideline. Beyond the guideline the section covers Who is affected by the design consideration, how you can be more mindful as well as how to test your work and finally additinal resources to dig a little deeper into accessibility.
